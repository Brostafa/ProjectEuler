# Project Euler

I decided to solve at least one problem at project euler per day. My solution for each problem will exist on its own branch

## Get started

```bash
# replace <repo_url> with this repo
git clone <repo_url>

# checkout to a problem
git checkout problem_1

# run the solution
yarn dev
```
